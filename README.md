# Maze-Solver
In this project there will be a path made up by black tape.On that path firstly,the bot will traverse the maze fully and after that it will solve the maze through shortest path.
Maze is a network of paths and hedges designed as a puzzle through which one has to find a way.
In context with code, our code is based on Arduino and can be categorized in three main parts-
Traversing-Our bot follows the principle of Power Left and covers the entire possible maze,including dead end and loops.Simultaneously it saves the path travelled in an array.In order to avoid repetation while travelling on any particular path the array's index is matched with the previous index and accordingly stored when some new type of path is recorded.If condition is used with the conditions of any white, which indicates traversing and count variable is used which will only be updated after reaching the finishing line.
Path Shortening-Here the path met in case of dead ends are removed by the principle for dead end which has a total of six possible conditions.We check the back("b") in our array,and takes two more character one after "b" and the other before "b" and then apply this principle,which ends up with removal of all the dead ends.Else if condition is used with condition of all black(indicating the finishing line),for is used to shorten,counter variable gets updated which directs our code to the third condition.Reference is taken from https://www.instructables.com/id/Maze-Solver-Robot-Using-Artificial-Intelligence-Wi/
Moving On Shortened Path-Now the array has stored the proper shortened path.Now the IR sensors will sense at the junction.From the stored shortened path it will execute accordingly and traverse the maze along the shortest route.
